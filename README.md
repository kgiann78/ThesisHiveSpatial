Thesis for executing Spark Geo-spatial Queries with Hive

This thesis is using ESRI Geometry and Spatial Framework for Hadoop and Spark

Additional to this exists the Hadoop cluster with Spark implemented for docker at https://github.com/kgiann78/hadoop-cluster-spark-docker.

That is the infrastructure where the spark applications and the Thrift server are taking place.
